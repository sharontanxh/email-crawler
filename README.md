### Introduction

Work-in-progress hackathon project from HACKHERS 2023.

Have you ever struggled to get a handle on your email? Wouldn't it be great if your email client could intelligently figure out which emails needed follow-up actions and create your to-do list automatically?

### Project Structure

- gpt_client.py: Authenticate and pull emails
- streamlit_main.py: Main streamlit page for prototype UI
- email_classification.ipynb: Generate LLM output from emails
